Project: Astronomy Picture of the Day Search
Explaination:
My option is
Astronomy Picture of the Day Search
So the logo that I selected will be a rocket with 3 key colours: white, red, and blue. I selected this colour because it is the colour that is relevant to the earth. 
The name of my website is Meteor which is a kind of very beautiful star that people can see on the sky but not usually. 
I selected Seogo Print font because it brings a creative feeling to me and the users. 
A simple website interface will be an advantage because everyone can manipulate and get what they want.
