Project: Astronomy Picture of the Day Search<br/>
Explaination:<br/>
My option is<br/>
Astronomy Picture of the Day Search<br/>
So the logo that I selected will be a rocket with 3 key colours: white, red, and blue. I selected this colour because it is the colour that is relevant to the earth. <br/>
The name of my website is Meteor which is a kind of very beautiful star that people can see on the sky but not usually. <br/>
I selected Seogo Print font because it brings a creative feeling to me and the users. <br/>
A simple website interface will be an advantage because everyone can manipulate and get what they want. <br/>
